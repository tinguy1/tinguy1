About Me
I focus on creating unique and advanced projects, primarily related to Discord enhancements and other innovative applications. While I don't frequently publish my repositories, my work revolves around pushing the boundaries of what's possible with current technologies.

Current Projects

Discord Audio Modification Plugins
T1Nstereo v1: Status: Completed - [Public Repository]
T1Nstereo V2: Status: Completed - [Public Repository]
AVenhance (Audio Video Enhance) V3: Status: Completed, Private - The most advanced Discord audio/video utility plugin with a wide array of features.
Lite Basic Patch: Status: Archived - [Public Repository]
Lite Advanced: Status: In Progress - Similar to T1Nstereo but with advanced coding, adjustable settings, and dynamic application. [Obfuscated in Discord Server]

Discord Modification Plugins
AutoMute: Status: Upcoming - Automatically mutes users exceeding a specific audio threshold. [To be published obfuscated in my server]
Future Video and Stream Utility Plugins: Bypass Discord's quality restrictions.
AudioLevels: Status: Planned - Displays live audio levels for individual users in a Discord call.
FakeDeafen Revamped: Status: In Development - Emulates events like camera activation or muting. Included in V3, but planned as a separate plugin.
Future Plugin for Stealth Speaking: Enables speaking in calls without emitting the usual audio indicators.

Discord Bots
Vina (All-in-One Bot): Status: In Progress - Comparable to mainstream bots, a versatile tool.
Music Bot (Unnamed): Status: In Progress - A multiplatform music bot that bypasses Discord's bitrate limits, supports YouTube/SoundCloud/Spotify, and features interactive audio control (bitrate, volume, EQ, etc).
SelfBot: Status: In Progress - A utility-rich selfbot. Focus still being defined.

Other Projects
Electron Audio/Video Application: An advanced communication tool akin to Discord but with unlimited bandwidth and superior encoder qualities, leveraging P2P proxies, interactive and modern UI.
Electron Trading Bot Application: Features an interactive UI, strategy implementation, and comprehensive functionality. A significant project I plan to focus on beyond my Discord-related developments.
Possible electron discord client: I would make it very light comparative to discord, would feature modern UI design much better than some discord clients (cough cough, ripcord) and interactive audio, video, utilitie settings from all of my projects, this is very ambiguous towards all of the components I would have to actually implement.

Note on Licensing and Repository Access
I tend to keep many of my projects private or obfuscated, given the "advanced" nature of the work. Licenses in the JavaScript world can be nebulous, I try to be careful to respect intellectual property and or community guidelines in all my developments.
