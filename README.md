## About Me
As a developer with a passion for pushing the boundaries of technology, I specialize in creating unique and advanced projects. My focus is on Discord enhancements and other innovative applications.

## Licensing and Repository Access
Many of my projects are kept private or obfuscated due to the advanced nature of the work. In the realm of JavaScript, I am mindful of the ambiguous nature of licenses and strive to respect intellectual property and community guidelines in all my developments.
